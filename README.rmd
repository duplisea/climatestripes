### What are Climate Stripes?
Climate stripes are visualisations of climate change from a temperature time series (Climate Lab 2018). They are meant mostly as a communication tool to a lay public and can be grasped almost instantly. They were developed to have minimal annotation almost like a colour bar code. Legend and time axis options have been included here if one wants to convey a bit more information.


## Installation
```{r loadccca, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("duplisea/climatestripes")
```

```{r loadpackage, message=FALSE}
library(climatestripes)
```

## Make climate stripe plots for data downloaded from NASA's GISS Surface Temperature Analysis

Suface air temperature data was downloaded for St Margaret's Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada to use as an example.

```{r annualplot}
temperature.vector= stmargaretsbay$metANN
# set the missing value code (999.9) to NA
temperature.vector[temperature.vector==999.9]=NA
time.vector= stmargaretsbay$YEAR

climate.col.stripes.f(time.vector= time.vector,temperature.vector= temperature.vector,
  colour.vec=c("navyblue", "red"),
  title="Annual Average Temperature - St Margaret's Bay, NS, Canada",
  legend=T,
  legend.text.col="yellow")
```

This clearly shows a warming particularly since the early 1980s. There is a cooling from the mid 1990s to early 2000s and then the temperature increases in the second decade of the 2000s which includes the warmest years on record. The legend shows that the warmest year was 8.6 °C while the coldest was 4.1 °C. Years without data are shown without colour.

This is not exactly the same as climate lab's plots who use a three colour gradient and they do not seem to use datasets with missing values or perhaps their missing data are colour coded with the average (white).  The climate lab climate stripes also tend to work on anomalies in which case a three colour gradient makes a lot of sense.

You can make colour stripes plot closer to the look of those developed by climate lab using a multicolour  gradient. In the one below, "white" was added as the middle colour and different points along the gradients were marked with particular colours and this gives the light blues of the Climate Lab climate stripes. Experiment with different gradients and you may find something that works better for you. You could add as many colours as years even.

```{r climatelabplot}
climate.col.stripes.f(time.vector= time.vector,temperature.vector= temperature.vector,
  colour.vec=c("navyblue","lightblue","white","red","darkred"),
  title="Annual Average Temperature - St Margaret's Bay, NS, Canada",
  legend=T,
  legend.text.col="yellow")
```

This missing data in the 2012 period now look like average data though so it is deceptive. I personally prefer the two colour gradient on absolutes and not anomalies with missing data coded white. I think it is the most intuitive since anomalies are more difficult to explain to the lay public and it is easy to show missing data points.

## Make a climate stripe plot for just one month from the GISS dataset

```{r septemberplot}
temperature.vector= stmargaretsbay$SEP
temperature.vector[temperature.vector==999.9]=NA
time.vector= stmargaretsbay$YEAR
climate.col.stripes.f(time.vector= time.vector,temperature.vector= temperature.vector,
  colour.vec=c("navyblue", "red"),
  title="September Average Temperature - St Margaret's Bay, NS, Canada",
  legend=T,
  legend.text.col="white")
```

## An annual climate stripe image with one plot for each month of the year

```{r allmonthplot}
months=c("JAN","FEB","MAR","APR","MAY","JUN","JUL","AUG","SEP","OCT","NOV","DEC")
monthcols= match(months,names(stmargaretsbay))
time.vector= stmargaretsbay$YEAR
par(mfcol=c(6,2),mar=c(.2,.1,.5,.1))
for (i in monthcols){
  temperature.vector= stmargaretsbay[,i]
  temperature.vector[temperature.vector==999.9]=NA
  climate.col.stripes.f(time.vector= time.vector,temperature.vector, colour.vec=c("navyblue","red"),title=months[i-1], time.scale=F)
}
```

The axis has been omitted to bring out the general pattern and comparison between months. The legends give an idea of the actual temperature each month.
