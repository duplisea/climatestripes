\title{Draws climate stripes given a time vector and environmental (usually temperature) vector}
\usage{
climate.col.stripes.f(time.vector, temperature.vector, col1 = "blue",
  col2 = "red", title = "", time.scale = T, legend = T,
  legend.text.col, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{time.vector}{the time series vector}

\item{temperature.vector}{a times series of any environmental variable (climate stripes have been developed for temperature) whose values correspond to the time vector}

\item{col1}{the colour for the lowest values of the temperature vector}

\item{col2}{the colour for the highest values of the temperature vector. A gradient between col1 and col2 is drawn for the other colours}

\item{title}{a title for the colour stripes plot if you want one}

\item{time.scale}{show a temporal axis. Default TRUE}

\item{legend}{puts a legend for the colour gradient on the top right of the plot with the lowest and highest values shown. Default TRUE}

\item{legend.text.col}{colour of the legend text}

\item{...}{additional arguments that plot will accept, see par}
}
\description{
Climate stripes are a simple way of showing how temperature (or any other time series) has changed over time. They are usually
      drawn for a temperature time series with blue being the coldest years and red being the warmest. They offer a relatively uncluttered
      depiction of a temperature over time that can be grasped almost immediately and are good at showing climate change from long time series.
}
\details{
This plot will always use both end of the colour series provided. So if your colours were blue and red and you had a two years times series
      then one stripe will be blue and the other red. i.e. the plots are meant to show changes not absolutes. This is a good reason why a legend
      might be excluded. They are usually not for communication to scienific audiences unless in as a quick slide in a presentation so consider
      not cluttering up the image with a legend and perhaps not even an axis.

      Missing points in the time series should be NA for the variable. They are depicted as white spaces on the climate stripes plot. You will not
      get an error with missing points in the time series but it will show the stipes of the preceeding time series point to be wider. It is also
      deceptive to not include missing data.
